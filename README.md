This repository contains the source code of the Google Application Engine used to run mywindstats.com.

It captures data from various weather station (LÃ©ry-Poses, Le Crotoy, portable anemometer), store them and allow the end user to display a subset of these data in different form (table, graph, windrose). In addition, the application allows to perform short term windspeed prediction based on a neural network. The prediction is still in beta form.
