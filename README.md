This repository contains the source code of the Website mywindstats.com running on Google Application Engine.

It captures data from various weather stations (LÃ©ry-Poses, Le Crotoy, portable anemometer), store them and allow the end users to display a subset of these data in different forms (table, graphs, windrose). In addition, the application allows to perform short-term windspeed predictions based on neural networks. The prediction is still in beta form.
